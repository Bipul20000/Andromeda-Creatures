# Andromeda-Creatures

Weâ€™re taking you on a visual journey through the solar storms of May 2024, using real NASA data. Our goal is to show how these storms impacted Earth from disrupting communication systems to creating stunning auroras. With this, we want to make space weather both exciting and easy to understand for everyone.
